# Countdown-Timer-using-Python


### Project Prerequisites
Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library from which we can build GUI applications in the fastest and easiest ways.

The playsound module is used when we want to play audio files with a single line of code. This doesnâ€™t have any dependencies.

The Python time module provides ways to represent time.

### To install the library, please run pip install command in prompt:
pip install tkinter                                                                                                                                                                                     
pip install time
pip install playsound
